  ],
  method: [
    1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (or 160°C for fan ovens) or gas mark 4.
    2. Grease a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with parchment paper.
    3. Beat 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar together until light and fluffy. Gradually add 2 beaten large eggs, mixing in a little of the 140g flour with each addition.
    4. Gently fold in the remaining flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 2 mashed bananas.
    5. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for around 50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Start checking for doneness at 30-40 minutes by testing with a skewer every 5 minutes, as baking time may vary depending on the tin's shape.
    6. Let the loaf cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack.
    7. To make the icing, combine 50g icing sugar with 2-3 teaspoons of water to create a runny mixture.
    8. Drizzle the icing over the cooled loaf and garnish with a handful of banana chips.],
